Andy!

How's it going!?

So yeah, I took a look at the site you built for your wife. 

Since you mentioned media queries, I thought I'd do a couple things to tweak the design. Hope you don't mind. 

Right now it's just a single column, but it translates well to mobile (at least in FF). Mobile First they say!

I've uploaded everything I did. I only did the welcome page.

I would do more, but I want the rest of my Sunday for me, but I had a lot of fun doing this! 

I learned a lot. Hope you like it!
